#Introduction 
Easysave is a back up folder software. It's a school project created by a team of 4 students. 

#Context
Our team has just integrated the software publisher ProSoft.   Under the responsibility of the CIO, we are in charge of managing the "EasySave" project which consists in developing a backup software.  As any software of the ProSoft Suite, the software will be integrated into the pricing policy.
- Unit price : 200 €HT
- Annual maintenance contract 5/7 8-17h (updates included): 12% purchase price (Annual contract tacitly renewed with revaluation based on the SYNTEC index)
During this project, we will have to ensure the development, the management of major and minor versions, but also the documentation (user and customer support).  To ensure that our work can be taken over by other teams, we must work within certain constraints such as the tools used. 

#Built with 
- [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/fr/vs/) (enterprise version)
- [Visual Pardigm](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/) (for diagram)
- [Azure Repos](https://azure.microsoft.com/fr-fr/services/devops/repos/)

#Version 1.0
The specifications of the first version of the software are as follows : 

The software is a Console application using .Net Core. It must allow the creation of up to 5 backup jobs.

A backup job is defined by :

- An appellation
- A source directory
- A target directory
- One type
- Full
- Differential
- the software have to be understandable by english person

The user may request the execution of one of the backup jobs or the sequential execution of the jobs.
The directories (sources and targets) can be on local, external or network drives.
All the elements of the source directory are concerned by the backup.

Daily Log File :

The software must write in real time in a daily log file the history of the actions of the backup jobs. The minimum expected information is :
- Timestamp  
- Naming the backup job
- Full address of the Source file (UNC format)
- Full address of the destination file (UNC format)
- File Size 
- File transfer time in ms (negative if error)    

Status File The software must record in real time, in a single file, the progress of the backup jobs.  The minimum expected information is :  

- Timestamp  
- Naming the backup job
- Backup job status (e.g. Active, Not Active...) 
If the job is active
- The total number of eligible files
- The size of the files to be transferred 
- The progression         
- Number of remaining files  
- Size of remaining files  
- Full address of the Source file being backed up
- Complete address of the destination file
- The locations of the two files described above (daily log and status) will have to be studied to work on the clients' servers. As a result, "c:\temp" type locations are to be avoided.

The files (daily log and status) and any configuration files will be in XML or JSON format. In order to allow fast reading via Notepad, it is necessary to put line feeds between the XML (or JSON) elements. A pagination would be a plus.

#Version 2.0

EasySave 1.0 has been distributed to many customers.  

Following a customer survey, the management decided to create a version 2.0 with the following improvements:  

* Graphic Interface 

Abandoning Console mode. The application must now be developed in WPF under .Net Core. 

 * Unlimited number of jobs 

The number of backup jobs is now unlimited.  

* Encryption via CryptoSoft software 

The software will have to be able to encrypt the files using CryptoSoft software (made during prosit 5).  Only the files with extensions defined by the user in the general settings should be encrypted. 

 * Evolution of the Daily Log file 

The daily log file must contain additional information: Time needed to encrypt the file (in ms)   
 
* Business software 

If the presence of business software is detected, the software must prohibit the launch of a backup job. In the case of sequential jobs, the software must complete the current job and stop before launching the next job. The user will be able to define the business software in the general settings of the software. (Note: the calculator application can substitute the business software during demonstrations).
